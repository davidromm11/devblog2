      <p class="author-description">
      Welcome to my digital space! I'm a recent Data Science graduate from St. Lawrence University with a passion for tech, especially cybersecurity. I'm currently spending time researching the field with the goal of building a career around it.
      </p>
      <p class="author-description">
      Outside of tech, you'll often find me at the golf course, at the gym, or spending time with my friends and family. I also enjoy cooking and fishing.
      </p>
      <p class="author-description"> 
      I've always been the type of person who can't fully grasp a topic until I understand <i>everything</i> about it. This pushes me to learn deeply and solve problems with a thorough, well-informed approach. There is something very satisfying about learning and applying that knowledge to problems, especially in IT. 
      </p>
      <p class="author-description"> 
      This blog serves a few purposes: it's my space to practice web development, vps configuration, web hosting, and writing. It's also a place where I can organize my thoughts and solidify my comprehension of topics, all while tracking my progress. Over time, I hope these posts will turn from personal learning notes to something that helps others on their journey.
      </p>
      <p class="author-description">
      Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me! I'm excited to share this journey with you and hope you find the content here helpful and interesting.
